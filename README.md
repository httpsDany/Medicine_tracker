THis project is made using real life data scraped using crawler from inline pharmacy websites like pharmeasy and Apollo.
The scrapers were purely made by python [AI assistance was used in devloping crawlers]
The project was made from point of view of startups rising in online pharmacy market and need a simple and straight forward way to compare prices and discount provided by other companies, and the mrp of the medicines.

Its a minimilistic website designed to showcase the logic handling rather the focusing on immense data.
Future scope for the project can be:
Marking cities of india where specific medicines are not in stock
Plotting a graph for better visualization of data
